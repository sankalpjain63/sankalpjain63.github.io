## 4. If you have come till here, something not on my resume:

I have a deep sense of commitment to those less fortunate than myself, and I have found that working with organizations like Make A Difference NGO has given me an incredible opportunity to help those in need. My work with marginalized and abandoned children, providing them with after-school programs and fundraising events, has been some of the most rewarding experiences of my life.
