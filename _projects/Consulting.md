## The project and duties I performed as a senior consultant:

### Objective:

As a Senior Consultant in the Business Intelligence Group, I aimed to lead a team of 5 consultants in providing strategy consulting to facilitate our client's entry into the healthcare domain with a digital healthcare service.

### Description:

In this project, our team embarked on a comprehensive strategy consulting initiative to assist our client, a leading telecom company, in venturing into the healthcare domain with a digital-healthcare continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) service. Leveraging our expertise in business intelligence, we conducted a thorough analysis utilizing various frameworks and tools.

#### SWOT Analysis:
Strengths                                    	Weaknesses 
- Strong brand recognition in telecom sector  - Limited experience in healthcare industry 
- Access to extensive customer data	          - Lack of established network in healthcare sector 
- Robust technological infrastructure	        - Initial investment required for market entry

Opportunities                                         Threats
- Growing demand for digital healthcare solutions     - Intense competition from established healthcare players
- Expansion opportunities in emerging markets	        - Regulatory hurdles and compliance requirements
- Potential for strategic partnerships and alliances  - Rapidly evolving technological landscape

#### Porter's Five Forces Analysis:
* Threat of New Entrants: Moderate - While barriers to entry such as regulatory requirements exist, the increasing demand for digital healthcare solutions presents opportunities for new entrants.
* Bargaining Power of Suppliers: Low - With a wide range of healthcare technology providers, the bargaining power of suppliers is relatively low.
* Bargaining Power of Buyers: High - Customers have a high bargaining power due to the availability of alternative digital healthcare solutions.
* Threat of Substitutes: High - There is a significant threat of substitutes from traditional healthcare providers and other digital healthcare platforms.
* Competitive Rivalry: Intense - The healthcare sector is characterized by intense competition from both established players and new entrants, necessitating differentiation strategies.


### Challenges: 
1. Navigating the complex regulatory landscape of the healthcare industry posed significant challenges. We had to meticulously research and analyze regulatory requirements and compliance standards to ensure that the client's digi-healthcare service met all legal obligations.

2. Another challenge was gaining buy-in and acceptance of our recommendations from stakeholders within the client organization. To overcome this, we developed persuasive narratives supported by robust data analysis and visualizations. By presenting our findings in visually compelling formats, such as infographics and interactive presentations, we effectively communicated the value and feasibility of our proposed strategies.

### Conclusion:

1. Our strategic consulting efforts have equipped our client with a robust framework for entering the healthcare domain with confidence. Through SWOT and Porter's Five Forces analyses, we identified key opportunities and challenges, enabling the client to formulate informed strategies.

2. Moving forward, our client is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for digital healthcare solutions, leveraging their strengths and addressing potential weaknesses and threats. By embracing innovation and strategic partnerships, they can establish a strong presence in the healthcare sector and drive sustainable growth in the long term.
