## Data Visualization


##### This project displays the usage of Tableau+Power BI+Excel to your github repository.

## Objective: 
To investigate and analyze the relationship between various reservation details and Airbnb bookings in three major cities in the United States. The goal is to find and display any correlations and patterns in the data and to offer insights into how Airbnb visitors in these cities book their stays.

## Description: 
 • Analyzed Airbnb database for 3 city-wise correlations. Visualized reservation patterns using Tableau & Power BI, helping 500+ hosts & management understand occupancy and preferences
 • Generated ETL Data Model; combined 2 calendar & listing data through SQL, provided easier, faster information to 1000+ visitors per month


## Challenges: 
1. Preparing the data for ETL processing in Talend by removing unnecessary lines and formatting the parameters to streamline the dataset.
2. Visualizing correlations between the room types in the Airbnb data for the cities of Chicago, New York, and Boston.
3. Addressing the issue of outliers that were affecting the overall correlation results.

To overcome the challenges, I utilized various techniques such as reviewing class lecture notes, conducting online research, re-evaluating the datasets, removing null values and outliers, and ensuring proper data formatting and types.
